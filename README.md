# HikeTracker App

## General Description
*Track your hikes!* At a minimum, create a concise record of the hikes you've done. If you're interested in a more data-rich experience, log additional info about your hikes to be able to see records of and analyze your hiking mileage, elevation change, time, pace, and more.

## Technology used
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), with elements of Javascript, JSX, HTML, and CSS, using React Router, Jest, and other TBD stuff...
